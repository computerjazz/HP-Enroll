# Enrollment Form
Online Enrollment form for Harmony Project, a music non-profit with 2,000 students.

This Google Apps Script integrates with Google Sheets to collect online enrollment data and upload materials to a designated Drive folder.

The form is easily customizable by the organization -- Spanish translations and HTML selects are populated via data pulled from a separate Sheet (i.e. which instruments are offered).
